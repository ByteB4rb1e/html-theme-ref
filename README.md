Hiya. This is theme for my `tiararodney.com` personal website. It's consisting
of script and stylesheet assets to be applied to a HTML document.

I'm currently using Sphinx for generating web-frontends, but I want to be able
to also apply the same styling and behavior to, let's say a content-management
system like Wordpress. In the end, both are (just) HTML documents with scripts
and stylesheets applied. The way how scripts and stylesheets are applied to the
HTML document differs though. That's why it's necessary to basically find the
essence of 

Apart from WebAssembly, the web client technology stack basically is, what it
was 20 years ago. HTML 5 documents transferred over HTTP2, with CSS3 for
document render styling and ECMAScript 2023 for contextful scripting.  I am
being specific on the versions of these technologies, because it is an ultimate
required practice anyway to keep web clients (browsers) up to-date. All of
the latest versions of web browsers have these (latest) standards implemented in
the mentioned versions.

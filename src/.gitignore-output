# this .gitignore serves the purpose of allowing wrapping projects, that
# generate this project's assets dynamically, not having to worry about
# auxiliary debugging assets polution. The file is supposed to be copied by
# webpack into the output directory, so the globbing patterns shouldn't match
# the current directory. That's why it's called `gitignore` instead of
# `.gitignore` so that it isn't actually being picked up by git. webpack should
# rewrite the basename.

# Contribution Guidelines

This document serves as an outline on development principles. It is named
"Contribution Guidelines" out of convention, not because I'm necessarily hoping
for contributions.

## Bumping version

The project adheres to semantic versioninig. Bumping the version SHOULD only
apply to file changes under `src/`. Under certain circumstances it may make
sense to bump the version when other files are changed.
